 Project Workflow / Steps
 
1. Data Loading & Exploration (Python) :
Loaded dataset into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas
Reviewed data structure, data types, and summary statistics
Checked for missing values and data consistency

2️. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering :
Standardized column names (snake_case)
Renamed columns for better compatibility
Extracted date-related features (year, month, day)
Created additional calculated fields for analysis

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed sales distribution and customer behavior
Identified trends by product line, branch, and customer type
Visualized key patterns using Python plots

4️. Data Analysis Using SQL:
Imported cleaned dataset into SQL database
Wrote SQL queries to calculate KPIs such as:
Total Revenue
Total Profit
Average Sales
total unit sold
Profit rate
Used aggregation and grouping for business insights

5. Dashboard Development (Power BI) :
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with:
KPI cards (Revenue, Profit, Quantity)
Bar/Column charts (Sales by Product Line, Branch)
Line charts (Monthly Trends)
Pie/Donut charts (Payment Methods, Customer Segments)
Slicers for dynamic filtering

6️. Reporting :
Created a detailed project report documenting:
Analysis approach
Key findings
Business recommendations
